As per Davyd's PeanutButter.TempDb package.

//<summary>
//  LocalDb implementation of TempDb. TempDb will destroy the temporary database on disposal. However,
//      it is feasible that the Dispose method may not be called (eg aborting a test you're debugging),
//      so you can end up with orphaned tempdb databases registered against your localdb instance. Unlike
//      sqlite and SqlCe, where the file is the be-all and end-all of the database, localdb has a registration
//      mechanism, so deleting the file (ie, clearing out temp files) is not enough. The procedure below can
//      be run into your localdb master database and run at any time to purge orphaned tempdb_* databases
//-- procedure to run if you have orphaned localdb temp databases
//create procedure clear_temp_databases as
//begin
//    declare @tmp table (cmd nvarchar(1024));
//    insert into @tmp (cmd) select 'drop database ' + name from sys.databases where name like 'tempdb_%';
//    declare @cmd nvarchar(1024);
//    while exists (select * from @tmp)
//    begin
//        select top 1 @cmd = cmd from @tmp;
//        delete from @tmp where cmd = @cmd;
//        exec(@cmd);
//    end;
//end;
